In addition, we also provide tutorials for compiling and installing our software from source code, Please go to [here](docs/dev/How-to-Built.md) 🐧.

Until then, there are three things to note.

- ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Vulkan sdk is necessary, please [download](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) and install it.
- ⚠️⚠️⚠️ For linux, please make the AppImage file executable by the following command:
  ``` sh
  chmod +x MEC_SDL2_OpenGL3-linux-x86_64-x.x.x.AppImage
  ``` 
- ⚠️⚠️⚠️ And if you're using linux distros that use fuse3, and miss libfuse.so.2 to run the AppImage file, you can install it by:
  ``` sh
  sudo apt install libfuse2
  ```

## DEPENDENCIES
